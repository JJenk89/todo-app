## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This project has taught me a lot about basic React/JavaScript fundamentals such as:

-   Using and updating state using the useState hook
-   Conditional rendering
-   Rendering different state within the same page based on user clicks
-   Using local storage to save data client side
-   Creating drag and drop functionality from scratch for both desktop and mobile
-   Touch events
-   Refactoring code into smaller components
-   The useContext hook
-   Passing props
-   Implementing dark and light themes into an app
-   How to deploy a React app to github
-   How to push to a remote repository
-   Using git to create and merge branches

I feel I have a much stronger grasp on these fundamentals going forward and will be able to develop future projects much more efficiently as a result.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to use all the things I've learnt so far, and hopefully find new things to do. I would like to perhaps take on a basic full-stack project or something involving data calls from an API or backend.
